     Dr. Natasha Sekhon [<i>say-kho</i>] is an Assistant Professor of Geology at Occidental College. 
     Natasha received her B.S. from the University of California, Irvine, followed by a M.S. and Ph.D. from the Institute for Geophysics and Department of Geological Sciences at the University of Texas, Austin, respectively. She was a postdoctoral researcher
     at Brown Univerisity as a Voss Postdoc Research Associate and Presidential Postdoctoral Fellow. Dr. Sekhon studies changes in the hydroclimate cycle through time using stable isotope and trace element geochemistry. In her free time, Natasha enjoys participating in live performances, dancing, climbing or immersing herself in new cultures and trying new cuisines! <a href="https://github.com/nsekhon1991/wickatoxy/blob/master/files/Sekhon_CV_Jan2026.pdf"> CV here </a>.

<u>Mira Hart ('26)</u><br>
     Mira is the longest WICK Lab member! <br>
     Mira has been working on projects in the Philippines. On a <a href="https://www.oxy.edu/academics/student-research/urc/student-funding-projects-travel/asp-research-travel-grants">URC ASP Research Travel Grant</a>, Mira assisted Dr. Sekhon in the Philippines for 10 days. Field work is an integral part of the WICK Lab, and <a href="https://www.oxy.edu/magazine/issues/spring-2025/underground-history-climate-change">Mira helped collect cave monitoring data and stalagmite samples.</a> Mira is working on her Senior Comps investigating how tropical hydroclimate responds to periods of Rapid Climate Change. She is working on the stable isotope and trace element reconstruction of two stalagmites that grew over Heinrich Stadials 2 - 4. <br> 
     When Mira is not in the lab, she enjoys trying new coffee shops, spending time with friends, and exploring Los Angeles. You will also find Mira outside hiking, playing golf, or paddle boarding. 
You can connect with Mira on her <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mira-hart-580a78357/">Linkedin.</a>

<u>Alex Witten ('26)</u><br>
     Alex is working with Dr. Sekhon to start a project in northwest India. Previously, Alex worked used Landsat data over SEKI NP to isolate pre- and post- KNP Complex fire burn severity in carbonate watersheds. After spending summer 2025 in Nepal, Alex is using satellite imagery and machine learning techniques to explore caves in northwest India. This project is in collaboration with postdoctoral scholar, Dr. Maggie Furtner at the National Cave and Karst Research Institute.  
     <br>In his free time, Alex enjoys surfing, climbing, and exploring the Sierra Nevada Mountains. You can connect with Alex on his <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alex-witten-65538337b/">Linkedin.</a>

<u>Christopher Cronk ('26)</u><br>
     Christopher is working with the WICK Lab and <a href="https://www.oxy.edu/academics/faculty/amy-holmes-tagchungdarpa">Prof. Amy Holmes-Tagchungdarpa</a> to characterize the geochemistry and cultural significance of soils from Sikkim. With collaborators at UT Austin, Christopher will analyze XRF, pH, XRD on collected soil samples that hold deep cultural significance for the Indigenous people of Sikkim. This project is funded by Occidental College's Young Initiative Grant awarded to Profs. Sekhon and Holmes-Tagchungdarpa.
     <br>In his free time, Christopher looks to the natural world to learn about agriculture, medicinal plants, and Indigenous ways of knowing. He likes to watercolor and play the guitar -- as well as write songs about his experiences. Christopher stands in solidarity with Indigenous Peoples being displaced globally, as he believes this goes hand in hand with the scientific community's efforts to mitigate and adapt to climate change.

<u>Street Senan ('27)</u><br>
     Street has been working on their own project in the WICK Lab since Summer 2025 as a <a href="https://www.oxy.edu/academics/student-research/urc/oxy-student-research-fellowships/summer-research-program-fellowship">SRP fellow.</a> They are working on a stalagmite sample that grew through the last deglaciation in the Philippines. When Street is not in the lab they like to get outside by hiking, skiing, and rock climbing. Street also loves listening to music while reading in the sun, and cooking new recipes with loved ones!

<u>Solvej Lee ('26)</u><br>
     This is Solvej's first year working with the WICK lab! Last year (AY24/25) Solvej with the Religious Studies department: Dr. Amy Holmes-Tagchungdarpa, Jocelyn Pedersen, and fellow student Hannah Lieberman on a project comparing indigenous ink-making techniques with black soil in Sikkim, North India, and cochineal in Southern California. From this project emerged Solvej's current work with the WICK lab, which is examining the geochemical properties of the Sikkimese black soil in conversation with its spiritual, social, and ecological significance. <br>
In her free time, Solvej enjoys drawing, music, watching movies, and being in the sun. In the future she hopes to continue advocating for indigenous perspectives in the sciences, and to explore the connection between life science and geoscience.
